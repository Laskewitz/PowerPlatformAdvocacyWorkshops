# LAB üë∑üèΩ - Build Reusable Copilots with Templates in Copilot Studio

Microsoft Copilot Studio is the place to extend existing Copilots or create your own copilot. But what if you want to create a template in Copilot Studio to limit the amount of manual work? There is a feature called "templates" available. This enables you to export an existing copilot as a template and create the copilot based on that template. In this lab, you can learn how to create a copilot, export it as a template and create a new copilot based on that template.
