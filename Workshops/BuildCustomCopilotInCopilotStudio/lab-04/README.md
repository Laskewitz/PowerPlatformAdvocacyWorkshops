# Lab 04 - Create a custom topic with a prompt action for generative responses

A prompt action can also be executed inside of a Topic to create a controlled user experience and add further logic and/or processing of the copilot. The prompt action can be added as an action inside the authoring canvas.

In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:
* [4.1	Adding the prompt action to a Topic](#41adding-the-prompt-action-to-a-topic)

## 4.1	Adding the prompt action to a Topic

    ![4.1_10_InsertPowerFx](assets/4.1_10_InsertPowerFx.jpg)

1.	The Send a message node will now display the output from the plugin action.	Select **Save** on the top right of the authoring canvas to save the updated Topic.

    ![Send A Message](assets/4.1_11_SendAMessage.jpg)

1.	The plugin action created earlier for the prompt plugin needs to be modified to prevent the plugin action executing outside of the Topic. Navigate to **Actions (preview)** in the left hand side menu and select the plugin action created earlier. Scroll down and under **Dynamic chaining**, untick the **Enabled** checkbox.

    ![Untick Enabled checkbox](assets/4.1_12_UpdatePluginAction.jpg)

1. Next, the response to the user needs to be disabled since the response will be returned from the Topic. In the **Outputs** tab untick the **Respond to the user after running this action** checkbox. Select the **Save** icon on the top right. 

    ![Update plugin action](assets/4.1_13_UpdatePluginAction.jpg)

1.	Now let‚Äôs test the updated copilot by triggering the recently created Topic. Navigate to **Topics** and select the Topic created earlier.

    ![Select Custom Topic](assets/4.1_14_SelectCustomTopic.jpg)

1.	Select **Test copilot** on the top right.

    ![Test Copilot](assets/4.1_15_TestCopilot.jpg)

1. Enter a prompt such as, 

    ```
    Can you please provide me with learning resources for building with Power Apps
    ```

    ![Prompt](assets/4.1_16_EnterPrompt.jpg)

1.	The Topic will be triggered with a message sent to the user about compiling the list of learning resources, followed by the prompt response as copilot executed the AI Plugin action. In the tracing mode view, you‚Äôll see that the Topic succeeded with the green tick icon displayed.
